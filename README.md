# Welcome to My Allocine
***

## Task
The main task of this project is to interact with a SQL database that stores movie-related information. 
The challenge involves writing SQL queries to retrieve specific data from multiple tables in the database. 
This requires understanding the database schema and crafting SQL statements that correctly and efficiently retrieve the desired information.

## Description
The problem is solved by writing a series of SQL queries to extract information from the database. The database contains several tables related to movies, actors, genres, directors, and reviews. 
Each query is designed to perform a specific data retrieval task, such as finding all actors, retrieving movie titles and years, or identifying movies released in a particular year. 
The solution involves joining tables, filtering results, and using SQL functions to meet the requirements of each task.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:
1. Download the database file using the provided link. (wget https://storage.googleapis.com/qwasar-public/track-claris/movies.db)
2. Install SQLite3 on your system if it's not already installed.(sqlite3 movies.db)
3. Use the SQLite3 command-line tool to connect to the database.

## Usage
To run the project and execute the SQL queries, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have the my_allocine.rb file with the SQL queries properly defined.
2. Use the SQLite3 command-line tool to load and run the SQL queries against the movies.db database.
